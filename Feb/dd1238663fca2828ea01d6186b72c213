Workers and members of the Rivers State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party ran helter-skelter after twin explosives rocked the state party secretariat on Thursday. The party was holding its council membership primaries around 3pm when the explosives went off. It was gathered that before this time, several stakeholders were protesting against alleged imposition of candidates in some areas. Our correspondent gathered that the explosive device kept inside a Sports Utility Vehicle, which was parked in front of the secretariat located along the busy Aba Express Road, went off without warning. No group had claimed responsibility for the attack as at the time of filing this report. An eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity for his personal safety told our correspondent, “There was panic today as two dynamites exploded during the councillorship primaries of the PDP. “I was at the party secretariat. The dynamite was detonated by suspected bombers in an SUV car along the Aba Road office of the party secretariat at 3pm. “Party supporters, who were seen around the secretariat to support their preferred candidates, scampered for safety. “The reason for the blasts is not clear, but it might not be unconnected to allegations of imposition of candidates in some local government areas. But calm has returned to the secretariat.” Attempts to reach the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Sydney Tambari, were unsuccessful. Calls to his mobile telephone number were neither picked nor returned. A response to a text message sent to him on the subject was still being awaited as at the time of filing this report. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, promised to get back to our correspondent but had yet to do so as of press time.
