The stock market had on Monday started the month on a negative note, ending a five-day gaining streak. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited noted that the local bourse sustained its negative run, as profit-taking in bellwethers, namely Dangote Cement Plc, Zenith Bank Plc and United Bank for Africa Plc, prompted a fourth consecutive loss in the NSE ASI. They said the month-to-date loss increased to 1.5 per cent on Thursday, while the year-to-date gain moderated to 3.8 per cent. The analysts said, “The total volume of trades increased by 24.7 per cent to 629.41 million units, valued at N7.98bn, and exchanged in 4,753 deals. FBNH was the most traded stock by volume at 126.36 million units, while Guaranty was the most traded stock by value at N2.88bn. “Sectoral performance was broadly negative, following losses in the industrial goods (-1.2 per cent), Insurance (-1.1 per cent), banking (-0.3 per cent) and consumer goods (-0.1 per cent) indices. The oil and gas (+0.3 per cent) index was the sole gainer of the day.”
