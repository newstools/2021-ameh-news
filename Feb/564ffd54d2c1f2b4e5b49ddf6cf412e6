In the statement endorsed and issued by the Director, Public Affairs, Nigerian Communications Commission, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde saying In the course of its regular online surveillance aimed at protecting telecoms consumers and industry stakeholders, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has discovered a spurious Facebook Account purporting to be that of the Commission. We have since contacted Facebook Team to take down the fake account. The commission gave details says the fraudulent Facebook account with the name: “Nigerian Communications Commission – NCC – Info Zone” was opened by unidentified individuals, ostensibly to deceive and defraud unsuspecting members of the public, some of whom, as NCC believes, may have inadvertently signed on to the fake Facebook account. Also disclosed that it is important to emphasize that the official, authentic and verified Facebook account of the Commission is: “NIGERIAN COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION” with over 192,193 followers and the Commission strongly advises the general public and telecom consumers to beware of this cloned Facebook account, as the NCC has no affiliation whatsoever with it. “This is a typical case of profile cloning often used to create a fake profile identical to an original one, for the purpose of misleading and defrauding the unsuspecting general public.  “Members of the public are advised to disregard the Facebook Page and its contents in their entirety. “The NCC, as a responsible organisation, will continue to take measures towards protecting telecoms consumers and industry stakeholders.”
