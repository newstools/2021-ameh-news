THE National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has urged the All Progressives Congress to face governance and stop trying to poach PDP members. Secondus gave the advice while speaking to newsmen after he led members of the PDP National Working Committee to a closed-door meeting with the former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, at his Abuja residence on Thursday. The PDP chairman said, “We want to advise our brothers on the other side, especially some of these governors and leaders of APC to face the business of governance. Jumping around and looking for critical stakeholders of our party to poach will not resolve the issue of security or economy. “They are aware that security has broken down, the economy has broken down. They should face that business for which they are elected. I believe that this country belongs to all of us and we need unity to move it forward. “Our brother (Fani-Kayode) is firm and a man of his words. There is no amount of trick that will make him sway otherwise. He is firmly with PDP and we are back to business while preparing for 2023.” In his remarks, Fani-Kayode, who was delighted to play host to the party leaders, pledged loyalty to the PDP. He said, “I want to here and now state that whatever issue there may have been has been resolved.  We are moving forward as one. I never left the PDP; I’m in PDP and am proud to be here. “In any political family, if anybody feels hurt, people are meant to reach out. And this is an example of any quality leadership that the National Chairman of the PDP and his working committee have provided for our party.” Although the APC leadership was unavailable for comments, a top party source said, “To engage the PDP in brick bats over FFK is a waste of time. You saw the resistance that greeted moves to bring him in.”
