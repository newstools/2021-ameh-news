The company also saying it targets the addition of three lines of 9m metric tonnes total capacity in Adamawa, Edo and Sokoto States by 2023 for which it recently signed an agreement with Sinoma CBMI.  “This is expected to bring BUA Cement’s total capacity to 20million metric tonnes per annum upon completion.”  BUA Cement has earned a gross profit of N95.4 billion in its unaudited 2020 Full Year financial accounts representing 16% increase from N82.4bn in 2019.

According to Chairman of BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu in an interview recently, said that despite the strides made in the Nigerian Cement Industry in the past few years, there is still room for immense growth.  Rabiu who was quoted saying, Nigeria with its population of about 200 million people is still greatly underserved by the cement industry with current consumption levels at about 130 kilogrammes per head compared to smaller African countries with consumption levels at about 170 to 180 kilograms per head.  Nigeria’s cement consumption is expected to increase to about 200 kilograms per head in coming years which is one of the reasons why BUA Cement is ramping up its investments in new plants to be able to meet this potential demand as well as take advantage of regional export opportunities through the African Continental Free Trade agreement (AfCFTA) which came into effect in 2021.  BUA Company recently completed its corporate bond valued N115 billion which was reported oversubscribed to the tune of N137.82 billion.
