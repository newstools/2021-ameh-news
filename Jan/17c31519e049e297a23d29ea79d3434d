The Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, has warned importers of NAFDAC-regulated products to monitor the transactions of their clearing agents in order to avoid any embarrassment that may be caused as a result of the unprofessionalism of the agents. Adeyeye in a statement by the Director of Ports Inspection in the agency, Prof. Samson Adebayo, raised the alarm over the activities of agents at the sea and airports, saying they indulge in the forgery of documents. While insisting that offenders would be prosecuted when caught, NAFDAC warned clearing agents that where such sharp practices occur, the names of such erring agents would be compiled and sent to the office of the Comptroller General, Nigeria Customs Service for sanctions. The statement reads in part, “It is important to inform the general public of the unprofessional behaviour of some unscrupulous agents operating at the (Air and Sea Ports) and land who indulge in forgery and doctoring of documents. “All NAFDAC processes are now carried out as online transactions and upon completion, a ‘Release Notice’ that is verifiable using any QR Reader – is issued for each transaction. “All importers are admonished to always initiate the clearance processes by themselves (rather than asking their agents to do that) because even when they have genuine and complete documents, for whatever reasons, some clearing agents still submit forged documents. “In the coming quarters of the year, the agency will embark on rigorous but friendly sensitisation of various stakeholders on the automated port clearance of NAFDAC regulated products.” “NAFDAC as a responsible organisation is willing to collaborate with any stakeholder to facilitate trade within the ambit of law – both at various Ports and in all the formations and departments of the agency.”
