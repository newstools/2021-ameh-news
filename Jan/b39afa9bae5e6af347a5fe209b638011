The Central Bank of Nigeria governor inaugurate Steering Committee for reposition the Nigerian Commodity Exchange  The Governor of the CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) are set to invest a fresh N50 billion in the Exchange.   Emefiele disclosed this, at the Inaugural Meeting of the Steering Committee, set up to reposition the Nigerian Commodity Exchange (NCX), Abuja.   He however disclosed that the investment would be made through the Infrastructure Corporation (Infraco) in a push to make the exchange functional and halt the arbitrage of middlemen, under whom Nigerian farmers have suffered for decades.  The CBN Boss also announced the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to halt the on-going privatization of the Commodity Exchange, as the process was found to have become an obstacle to the repositioning of the organization.
