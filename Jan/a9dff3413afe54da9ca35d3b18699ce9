The Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria recently appealed to the CBN to make BDCs payout agents for diaspora remittances. The President, ABCON, Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, said the apex bank should leverage the over 5,000 licensed BDCs across the country to get dollars seamlessly to beneficiaries. Gwadabe said this would help in providing a more convenient channel for Nigerians in the diaspora to remit funds back to the country to boost economic development.
