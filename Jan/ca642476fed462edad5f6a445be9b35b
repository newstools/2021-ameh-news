He pointed out that a favourable exchange, a case of appreciation of the Naira, no doubt, would present good omen and improves manufacturing production.  However, the case has always been that depreciation in value of the Naira reduces manufacturing production, as observed in the various FX crises.  Engr Ahmed disclosed that as   MAN has consistently observed, FX crisis in which Naira value depreciates among convertible currencies such as the US$, strangulates and reduces the size of manufacturing in the country. This is because depreciation in Naira value causes manufacturing raw-materials and machinery imports to be more expensive, he added.  The president revealed that the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), our great Association will be marking its 50th Anniversary this year with series of activities and events. In due time, we will intimate you on the line of programmes as we count on your support in terms of wide coverage for a landmark celebration of this nature, he concluded.
