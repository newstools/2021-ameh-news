The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, on Thursday said the Federal Government was resuscitating and making airstrips functional across the country to combat insecurity and boost commercial activities. He stated this when a delegation sent by Emir of Hadejia and led by a former Deputy Governor of Jigawa State, Ibrahim Hassan, visited the minister in Abuja. Speaking specifically on Hadejia airstrip, Sirika said many reasons had pushed for the resuscitation of airstrips, among which was historical purposes and the need to combat insecurity. He was quoted in a statement issued in Abuja by an official of the ministry’s Public Affairs Department, Sani Datti, as saying, “As we are facing security challenges, siting functional airstrip in Hadejia will help in combating insecurity. “The airstrip can be used by the Nigerian Airforce, police and, of course, civil aviation.” He added, “We are starting now by engaging aviation experts and consultants to come up with an assessment. “In our plans, the airstrip is going to be managed in such a way that there is a plan for future expansion in terms of landmass and commercial activities.” On his part, Hassan told the minister that they were in his office to appreciate the ministry’s effort towards resuscitating Hadejia airstrip. He assured Sirika of the Hadejia Emirate’s support towards actualising the project.
