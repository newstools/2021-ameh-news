Remita, a leading electronic payment platform in Nigeria, has noted a surge in the number of prospective candidates seeking admission into tertiary institutions in Nigeria who purchase their ePINs for the 2021 Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) through its multiple payment options.  This development was confirmed recently as the examination body, Joint Admission and Matriculations Board (JAMB), announced registration deadline extension from May 15 to May 29, 2021, while the main examination date would now be from June 19 to July 3, 2021. In a communique issued at the end of a meeting held last weekend, the registration deadline was extended by two weeks. Consequently, more prospective candidates for UTME and Direct Entry (DE) 2021 have continued to patronize the Remita platform for the sale of JAMB ePINs. The candidates are to commence the process by registering their National Identification Number (NIN) by typing the word ‘NIN’, then space, adding their 11-digit NIN and sending as an SMS to 55019, e.g (NIN 00123456789). They would receive a 10-character confirmation code on the telephone number that would be used to purchase their ePIN. They are to then proceed to the Remita website (www.remita.net) and click ‘Buy JAMB form’, select ‘UTME’ or ‘Direct Entry’ and input their confirmation code, registered phone number, and other necessary details. Candidates can make payments using their debit or credit card, internet banking, mobile wallet, USSD and others options. Once payment is completed, PIN is delivered to the candidate’s email, phone number and also displayed on their Remita receipt.  Remita is a leading payment platform in Nigeria that helps individuals and businesses to easily settle bills of various kinds. The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is the Nigerian entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions.
