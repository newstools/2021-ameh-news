The National Housing Fund (NHF) was set up in 1992 to create a funding pool for Nigerians who want to build residential houses at an affordable cost. If you’re a Nigerian and you need funding to build your own living space, you can obtain a loan for this from the NHF.  How The National Housing Fund Works This funding pool is the accumulation of contributions from employees, self-employed persons, commercial and merchant banks, insurance companies, and the government. It’s held by the Federal Government through the NHF. Each of these parties gives a fixed percentage of their funds to the program. For example, employers deduct 2.5% of each employee’s monthly salary as contributions to the NHF. These monies are remitted to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN). Employers and employees alike can register for this program by filling and submitting the NHF 1 form (for employers) or NHF 2 form (employees).  The NHF loans are derived from this pool of contributions. Things You Can Use The Loan For You can apply for an NHF loan if you want to construct, renovate, or purchase a residential building.
