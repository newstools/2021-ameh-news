The management and board of the Directors of BUA Cement in the unaudited financial statement report released through The Nigerian Exchange (The NGX) to the investing public shortly showed PAT growth of 13.0% year on year to N22.37 billion while EPS printed N0.66 representing 13.0% growth year on year. According to the report, the growth in EPS was driven mainly by the strong topline growth 13.0% growth year on year, which offset the rise in operating expenses increase of 15.2% year on year. The report also noted that the revenue grew by 13.4% year on year to N61.19 billion in Q1-21, driven by the combination of increases in sales volumes by 3.5% year on year and price per tonne also grew by 9.6% year on year. Analysts believe the higher growth in price per tonne than volumes indicates that management offered lower discounts to key distributors. The management action may have been necessitated by the need to mitigate the impact of the local currency devaluation on margins. We highlight that the double-digit revenue growth is consistent with results from the other players in the industry DANGCEM grew by 33.5% year on year and LAFARGE also grew by 12.2% year on year.   The report also shown EBITDA grew by 21.0% year on year in Q1-2021, as the price-led increase in revenue was strong enough to offset the increase in operating expenses ex-depreciation grew by 15.2% year on year amidst the single-digit growth in the cost of sales ex-depreciation by 6.3% year on year. Similarly, the EBITDA margin rose strongly by 3.0ppts to 47.6% in Q1-2021. However, Cordros analysts highlight that energy cost per tonne by 8.2% year on year grew faster than the increase in volumes by 3.5% year on year, reflecting the pass-through impact of the local currency devaluation.   While Net finance cost rose marginally by 2.8% year on year in Q1-2021, as the decline in interest expense by 31.4% year on year partly offset the collapse in finance income by 90.3% year on year decline. We note that the company also reported FX losses of N280.00 million in Q1-2021, which was absent in Q1-20. The decline in interest income is traceable to the reduction in cash in the bank by 44.1% Year To Date to N68.83 billion.   Nevertheless, the overall, PBT grew by 23.1% year on year in Q1-2021 with related PBT margin improving by 3.2ppts to 40.5%, supported mainly by the price-led expansion in revenue. Consequent to the jump in tax expense of N2.40 billion in Q1-2o20 vs N339.65 million in Q1-2021, PAT still grew slower by 13.0% year on year to N110.00 billion.   Comment: Although Analysts are not impressed that the revenue growth was price-driven, they think the need to preserve margins due to higher energy cost must have compelled management to review its pricing strategy.   However, analysts at Cordros research anticipate that the Kalambiana line II 3MMT set to come on stream in H2-2021 will result in economies of scale that will impact margins positively.   As analysts expressed with the other players, they are concerned that the significant upward movement in yields in the fixed income is likely to cause a slowdown in activities in the real estate sector. The preceding will put some brakes on private sector demand for cement, it was stressed.
