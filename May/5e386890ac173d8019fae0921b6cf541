Text of the Convocation Lecture by Mr Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank
of Nigeria, to mark the Annual Convocation Ceremony of Bayero University, Bayero
University, Kano, 26 February 2010  1. Protocols
May I begin by thanking the Vice-Chancellor, the Senate and Congregation of this great university for the honour of inviting me to deliver this year’s convocation lecture. I am not a graduate of this esteemed institution but my links to it are indeed very deep. On a purely personal level, this university is named after my great grandfather and I take personal pride in being the first among his descendants to stand here and deliver an academic paper. But also, and this may not be known to many of you, some of the earliest professors of this university including a former Provost are my maternal uncles and great uncles. I am proud to count among my mother’s uncles some of the professors associated with this university from its earliest days, such as Professor Shehu Galadanci (Arabic) and the late Professor Muhammad Kabir Galadanci (Hausa), and besides them countless uncles and cousins on the academic staff. While I did my own stint as an academic in the economics department of ABU Zaria in the early 80’s, I am most proud that my younger brother, Abubakar, Wambai Sanusi is on the academic staff of the economics department of BUK. But this is not all. The 2010 convocation comes with other unplanned joys. In addition to honouring me with the
opportunity to take the podium today, the University will tomorrow honour my great-uncle, an illustrious son of this city, AVM Nura Imam (rtd,) with a doctorate degree. And before you think I am through, my immediate younger sister, Zainab Sanusi, is one of the students  receiving a Master’s degree tomorrow. This could not have been planned better. For all these reasons, and for the many friends and academic colleagues here, this feels truly like a homecoming and I do pray it will be a successful one READMORE
