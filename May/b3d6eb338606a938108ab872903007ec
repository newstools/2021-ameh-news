The Federal Ministry of Transportation has revealed that the embattled Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Hadiza Bala Usman was engaging in obvious profligacy and wastage of public funds by spending over Fifty Billion Naira on an annual basis on Channel Management contracts.In a statement by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, there has been recent attempts by Hadiza and her media handlers to distract the 11-man panel recently set up to investigate the alleged corruption in the agency. According to her, Channel Management’ contracts have been routinely awarded over the years by the Nigerian Ports Authority at a cost of between 50 and 60 Billion Naira on an annual basis. The Honourable Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, however reportedly ordered NPA to stop awarding the contract, and rather, NPA should undertake the job of channel management on an in-house basis through the acquisition of the necessary machinery and professional capacity given the humongous annual sums paid out to dredging Contractors by the Authority. “Pursuant to the above directive, the Ministry’s Maritime Services Department vide a letter No. T0160/S.30/T4E/T2/61 dated 2nd February, 2021, to the Managing Director, NPA titled “REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE EXPIRED CONTRACTS: CHANNEL MANAGEMENT AND MANAGING AGENT CONTRACTS”. The letter, inter alia, requested the NPA to provide the following information for the Ministry’s records and further necessary action: ‘The current status of the Managing Agent contract and the measures put in place to cover the vacuum created as a result of expiration of the contract to prevent revenue loss to the government; “The current status of the Lagos and Bonny/Port Harcourt Channel management Companies and the measures put in place to cover the gap created by the expired contracts to ensure the channels are maintained for safe navigation and efficient service delivery; “The volume dredged annually from the channels and the depths achieved from inception management contracts to date and the amount expended; “The number of wrecks removed annually by the Channel Management Companies from inception of the contracts and amount spent; and READ ALSO THIS:  IMAGINE: NPA Expending N60billion Yearly On Channel Management Says Transport Minister I am to also convey the directives on the need for the Authority to procure its equipment for the service and cease from awarding any such contract.” It is instructive to note that despite the fact that the above letter was duly received by the NPA on the same 2nd February, the Authority has not deemed it necessary till date to respond to the Ministerial directives contained therein” the statement read in part. The transport Ministry accused Hadiza of attempts to pre-empt the outcome of the probe Panel’s work, unduly seeking to personalize a serious national issue bordering on transparency and accountability in the handling of public finances and attempt to drag the HMT into the arena of brick-bats and mud-slinging in order to force a distraction from the assignment now being undertaken by the Panel. The ministry was reacting to a publication, allegedly published by THISDAY Newspapers of Tuesday, 11th May, 2021, saying that Rotimi Amaechi had insisted on the channel management contracts being awarded to ‘two Chinese Companies’ of his own choice.  According to the newspaper, NPA under Hadiza had rejected the Minister’s proposal because it violated due process. The transport ministry said “It will not be drawn into an endless media war with faceless campaigners using certain media houses to pursue an agenda that can best be canvassed before the Administrative Panel already set up to unravel issues surrounding the management of the NPA since 2016” “The Panel has been charged to be fair and equitable in its deliberations and will certainly ensure that the primary purpose of the enquiry is the promotion of the principles of transparency and accountability which are strongly espoused in the present political dispensation”
