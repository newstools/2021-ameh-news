A  chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olabode George, has decried the “corruption and nepotism that have bedevilled the country.” He also kicked against what he called the Lagos State’s “attempts to shield looters” from prosecution. In a statement on Monday, George, while calling on Nigerians to chart a new way forward, attacked the law, ‘Lagos State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law,’ which was signed in April by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. By the law, anti-corruption commission is mandated to take over the investigation of all anti-corruption and financial crime cases involving the finances and assets of Lagos State Government being investigated by any other agency. George described the law as a self-serving, dubious and incongruous law that seeks to shield the looters of Lagos State treasury from the prosecutorial mandate of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. He said, “Sanwo-Olu’s legislation that seeks to shield criminals from federal prosecution is dead on arrival. It is elementary assertion that once a state law conflicts with a federal legislation, the state law is voided.” He added, “This is politics of deceit and self-serving glorification. They cherry pick what suits them, railroading their enemies into jail and protecting their own.”
