Wabote said it was a difficult bargain to be able to retain 50 per cent of the $10 billion Train 7 contract in country. He said the Local Content Act has helped to boost local capacity and it is expected that more local firms will be given opportunity to participate in the oil and gas industry. The upcoming fair he said will create more opportunities for local firms. The Board is also participating in four Modular Refinery projects as part of local content development. We have also invested in seven gas sectors as part of efforts to catalize the industries. According to him, NOGOF 2021 offers a great virtual experience, combining current technology to deliver collaboration between thousands of key players in the O&G sector which will help to grow business by seeing opportunities for quick decision making.  The event he continued promises to have over 1000 opportunities to be presented by international oil companies, independents, and other major players, with more than 1,500 registered participants. Attendees are expected from government agencies, industry regulators, as well as oil producing communities. The manufacturing sector, foreign investors and the financial institutions are not left out either, he added.  In continuation with the Boards practice to maintain an updated database of opportunities covering the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors, the 2021 version of the Compendium of Opportunities will be made available after the event.
