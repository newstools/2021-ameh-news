  Watch Boomerang’s My African Stories promo here  Storytelling has been integral to Africa for many generations. Along with song, rhythm and dance, Africans have been able to relay stories about their rich cultures and heritage since time immemorial. This year, just in time for Africa Month, Boomerang will launch My African Stories – a video series aimed at raising young African kids’ voices by allowing them to share unique, cultural moments of their daily lives with their peers across the continent.  Through an adventurous journey in “a day in the life of…”, the series will allow young boys and girls, aged between 4 and 9, to learn about the different cultures, traditions and practices fromSouth Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. This new local Boomerang initiativewill enable children from different parts ofAfrica to share their unique moments, from a kids’perspective. My African Storieswill immerse children across Africa in the legacy of tradition while experiencing daily tales from different African societies in a relatable way.
