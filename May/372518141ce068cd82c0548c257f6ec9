The market has been recording lower patronage recently as foreign investors continue to stay away. This development led to the total value of foreign investors hitting a four-low last month. “We highlight that the total value of foreign involvement in April is the lowest in four years (April 2017: N22.45 billion), which we believe was induced by rising bond yields in the advanced economies amidst lingering foreign exchange illiquidity in the country. “Meanwhile, the weak domestic participation was driven by a 66.4 per cent month on month (m/m) decline in retail investor’s participation which masked the 20.3 per cent m/m increase in institutional investors’ participation,” analysts at Cordros Securities said. The analysts said they maintained their expectation of weak domestic and foreign investors’ participation on the local bourse in the near term due to sustained rise in yields in the fixed income space and lingering liquidity constraints in the foreign exchange (FX) market. Looking at this week, they said they still expect a choppy theme with the bears dominating proceedings in the absence of positive triggers to spur a bullish performance.
“Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” they said. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as interest rate at 11.5 per cent. The MPC also voted to maintain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR and left the Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.
The MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.
