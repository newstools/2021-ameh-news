The management of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said attention of the Commissionh has been drawn to several media publications to the effect that the Commission will require Nigerians to submit the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of their phones to it from July, 2021. According to the statement endorsed by Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, Director Public Affairs of the Commission saying At no time did the Commission issue a Statement regarding the registration of IMEI by subscribers and it has no plans to do so.  He said the reports in question have emanated from a section of the Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration recently launched by President Muhammadu Buhari and which has been uploaded on the Commission’s website.  The spoke man of the Commission disclosed that It is pertinent to state that the Commission is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS). The DMS will essentially protect subscribers against phone theft and will identify and enable the elimination of fake devices from the networks. The system will capture IMEI automatically without any requirement for subscribers to submit same, he said.  “The general public is advised to disregard the said publications, which have created the erroneous impression that telephone subscribers will be required to register their IMEI with their networks.
