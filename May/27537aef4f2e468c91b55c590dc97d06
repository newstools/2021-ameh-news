The Lagos State Ministry of Education has said there are plans to upgrade the Sir Michael Otedola College of Primary Education and Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education to universities of education. The ministry also said the Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu would be upgraded to Lagos State University of Science and Technology. This was made known on Friday by the Lagos State Special Adviser on Education to the Governor, Mr Tokunbo Wahab, at the Ministry of Education press briefing in commemoration of the second anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. He said, “At the executive level, we have requested the upgrade of Sir Michael Otedola College of Primary Education and Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education to universities of education, and the Lagos State Polytechnic to Lagos State University of Science and Technology. “It is a known fact that there is discrimination between Higher National Diploma and a bachelor’s degree. Globally, those who colonised us have shut down their polytechnics.” In the same vein, the Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo, said the ministry planned to establish a radio station solely dedicated to education. “We plan to establish a radio solely dedicated to education, although it is a long process and approval has to come from Abuja, I think we are getting close to getting approval,” she said.
