CBN Officially Devalues Naira By N31.25, Fixes Exchange Rate At N410.25 To $1 According to the report saying the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has officially made the NAFEX Investor and Exporter forex window rate of N410.25 as its official exchange rate to the dollar. The report cited that It confirmed this new official rate on CBN website on Monday night, after it had removed N379/$ earlier in May. The AmehNews recall that CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele had said that the drop in crude oil earnings and the associated reduction in foreign portfolio inflows significantly affected the supply of foreign exchange into Nigeria. Emefiele said: “In order to adjust for the decrease in supply of foreign exchange, the naira depreciated at the official window from N305/$ to N360/$ and now hovers around N410/$.” The CBN had, in April 2017, established the I&E forex window as part of efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market and accommodate all forex obligations. The purpose of the window was to boost liquidity in the forex market and ensure timely execution and settlement for eligible transactions.
