A development that led to the decline in prices of 41 stocks, compared to only 26 stocks that appreciated. And analysts said the lower prices offer investors a good opportunity to enter the market. According to the analysts, this week, investors would focus on the outcome of the highly anticipated Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the fixed income (FI) market.

Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” they said.
