The management of Airtel Networks Limited cleared the air about the controversial operatiing license that during the launch of our flagship corporate social responsibility program titled Airtel Touching Lives, last week, a contrast was drawn between operating license and social license. According to the statement endorsed by Emeka Oparah, Vice President, Corporate Communications & CSR of Airtel Networks Limited saying Whilst the operating license is issued by Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC), we stated that a social license is earned by what a company does for its communities. We are very proud of our Touching Lives Program which gives support to the less privileged in our communities.  He however, for clarity, an operating license is always issued by NCC and our current license expires in November 2021. We have applied to NCC for its renewal ahead of this expiry date and the renewal process is in progress but yet to be concluded.  “We look forward to working with our various communities on the 6th edition of our Airtel Touching Lives Program.
