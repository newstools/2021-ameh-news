The Chamber, today, played host to the team of the Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (Lagos Global). The team was led by Mrs Abosede Oluwakemi George, Permanent Secretary Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Investments. The objective of the meeting was to seek collaboration between the Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment and the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce in the area of providing existing and potential Lagos State investors the required assistance, among others, in creating a conducive environment and leverage on the opportunities available to ease the process of doing business in Lagos State.  Mrs George further stated that the Lagos State government has a wide range of fiscal incentives, some of which include import concessions, tax exemption for exported products, and tax reductions for qualifying companies. She also added that the Agency under the leadership of Mrs Solape Hammond, Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Investments, will also be looking forward to a viable partnership with the Chamber in the areas of AGOA and export management. Mr Sola Obadimu, the Director-General of the Chamber, assured the team of the Chamber’s commitment to a formidable partnership, whilst further emphasising the need to put in place sustainable policies in achieving the agency’s goals.
