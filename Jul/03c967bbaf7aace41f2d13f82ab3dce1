In a year that required careful navigation of COVID-19 challenges, MultiChoice Group (MCG or the group) added 1.4m 90-day active subscribers to close the year ended 31 March 2021 the Full Year operational calendar stood at 20.9m subscribers.  According to the statement this represents a 2% acceleration in year-on-year (YoY)growth to 7%, as heightened consumer demand for video entertainment services, continued penetration of the mass market and an easing of electricity shortages in southern Africa improved growth rates. The 90-day subscriber base is split between 11.9m subscribers (57%) in the Rest of Africa and 8.9m (43%) in South Africa.  Revenue increased 4% (4% organic) to ZAR53.4bn, with subscription revenues accounting for ZAR44.7bn, a solid 5% (5% organic) increase YoY. Both advertising and commercial subscription revenues were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Advertising revenues were down 34% YoY (ZAR0.6bn) at the interim stage, but with less lockdown intensity in the second half and the return of live sport, it recovered well, ending 11% down YoY at ZAR2.8bn.  Similarly, commercial subscription revenues started to recover in the latter part of the financial year. At the interim stage it was down 46% but finished the year 35% lower than the prior year. The hospitality industry remains intermittent in its recovery due to lockdowns and is expected to take some time to normalise.  â€œGroup trading profit rose 28% to ZAR10.3bn (44% organic), benefiting from a ZAR1.5bn (ZAR2.7bn organic) reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa and 9% growth in South Africa.  According to the statement, this strong trading profit performance was due to resilient revenue growth, strong cost control and the impact of embracing new ways of working as a consequence of COVID-19 that reduced operating costs. It was further supported by a delay of ZAR1.1bn in sports events costs, which will be incurred in Full Year 2022, it stressed.
