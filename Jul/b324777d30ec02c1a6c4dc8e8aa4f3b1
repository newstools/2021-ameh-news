The Peoples Democratic Party has rejected the amended Electoral Act as passed by the National Assembly, calling it the “murder of democracy.” The National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, said this in Abuja on Friday during a media briefing. According to Secondus, the National Assembly has turned its back on Nigerians by putting party interest before national interest. He said, “We join our voices and anger with that of Nigerians and all lovers of democracy in condemning what happened in the National Assembly yesterday Thursday and today Friday. “How a representative of the people enjoying their mandate blatantly turned their back on them and toed the line of a political party interest that is clearly against the people. “By the choice of the All Progressives Congress to put party interest before national interest, they have vividly murdered democracy by the actions of their members in the two chambers of the National Assembly yesterday and today. “For us in PDP, today is a Black Friday for democracy.” Secondus added that a free, fair and credible election was the tripod of any democracy, saying that the APC itself was a beneficiary of the Electoral Reform under the PDP administration.
