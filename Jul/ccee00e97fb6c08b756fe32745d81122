The Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, yesterday lamented the spate of banditry and other nefarious activities afflicting the country, saying the nation is battling with the worst form of insecurity. He expressed worries that people who were living peacefully as neighbours, friends and were attending the same markets, weddings, funerals, and naming ceremonies without conflict, were now killing themselves and raping their wives and children. Masari, who spoke in Katsina, during the commissioning and handing over of Kafur Islamic Centre, urged the warring parties to sheathe their swords and work together to avert bloodletting bedeviling the country and for peace and development to thrive. The centre was donated by Wagf Su’ad Al’abdul Jaleel through As-sheikh Tariq, with the support of the African Continent Committee and the State of Kuwait. He said: “We are battling with the worse form of insecurity, what brought it?; People who were living peacefully before as neighbours and friends, attending the same market, weddings funerals, and naming ceremonies without any conflict. “But today, they are killing themselves, stealing their properties, and raping their wives and children. How come they turned overnight and started killing themselves? That means we have to examine ourselves. What went wrong? We should stop blaming the government because security is everybody’s business.” He, however, charged the management of the Islamic centre to be unbiased while giving out admissions to deserving applicants and educate residents of the host community on the need for unity to enhance harmonious co-existence. Earlier, the representative of the African Continent Committee, Sheikh Safakirukah Jumat, said the management of the centre would operate in line with the Islamic tenets and thanked Governor Masari for purchasing the land for the building.
