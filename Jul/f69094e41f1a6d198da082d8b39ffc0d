The Managing Director/Chief Executive, Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Mr. Bello Hassan has expressed the corporation’s readiness to partner the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) towards enhancing innovation in the delivery of services to depositors and other stakeholders. Speaking when he received the Director-General of the bureau, Mr. Dasuki Ibrahim Arabi and his management team on courtesy visit to the corporation, Hassan said the NDIC remained committed towards effective service delivery. He said this informed the swift approval by the NDIC board for the establishment of an Efficiency and Innovation Unit in the Strategy Development Department in compliance with the directive of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation. The NDIC boss, in a statement by the NDIC Director, Communication and Public Affairs, Mr. Bashir Nuhu, further restated the corporation’s support for external assessment of its performance and expressed the belief that the Self- Assessment Tool (SAT) developed by the bureau would complement the NDIC’s existing mechanism for assessing the effective discharge of its mandate. This, he said, will also assist it in achieving the federal government’s objectives of significantly strengthening governance and accountability in service delivery to the citizenry. Earlier, Arabi had explained that the IT-based self-assessment tool of the bureau is designed to coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of reforms as well as disseminate information on all aspects of public service, amongst other objectives. He expressed optimism in the corporation’s ability to implement the bureau’s self-assessment processes and its commitment towards putting innovation as a top priority to promote excellence in service delivery. He added that the BPSR will continue to collaborate with the NDIC as well as other government agencies in assessing their performance to ensure optimal discharge of their mandate to the populace
