Designed using the market capitalization methodology, the indices are rebalanced on a semi-annual basis on the first business day in January and in July.  It would be recalled that NGX recently announced the rebranding of its indices in line with NGX’s drive to standardise and ensure consistent expression of the brand across touchpoints. All indices were rebranded with a pre-fix, NGX – formerly NSE – to promote brand awareness and recognition. The exercise did not, however, affect the computation methodology of the indices, it was added.
