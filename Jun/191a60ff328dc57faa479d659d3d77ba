The Commissioner for Insurance (CFI), Mr. Sunday Thomas, disclosed this at a media retreat organised by the Commission in Lagos at the weekend saying that most of the insurance firms currently regarded as weak are not actually weak in the real sense of it considering the value of assets, we have many in the real estate sector.

Thomas said their actual problem is their inability to quickly turn those assets into cash and continue to discharge their responsibilities to the public NAICOM BossÂ said it has already started this through expertise advice on owners of various insurance firms who have in the past exceeded the maximum level of investment in real estate and are now facing cash crunch and could not easily turn their assets to cash to keep afloat in business. He further said it is strictly guiding operators to ensure that going forward none exceeds the 25 per cent maximum investment in real estate sector.
