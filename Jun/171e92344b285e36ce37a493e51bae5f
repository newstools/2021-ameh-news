The management of First Bank of Nigeria Limited has denied reports that it has closed its branches in the South-East part of the country due to the rising insecurity in the region. In a statement on Wednesday released by the bank’s Group Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Folake Ani-Mumuney, the reports are false and misleading. Ani-Mumuney noted that the bank’s South-East branches are fully open for business, asking their clients to disregard any news making the rounds. The statement titled, ‘Public Announcement’, read, “This is to inform the public that our South-East branches are fully open for business. Please disregard any news making the rounds that is contrary to this. Thank you.”
