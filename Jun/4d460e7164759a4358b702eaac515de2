The equities market maintained its positive performance for the second week running as investors swooped on stocks with attractive dividend yields ahead of first half (H1) 2021 interim declarations. The high demand lifted the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited All-Share Index (ASI) by 1.11 per cent to close at 39,156.28, while market capitalisation gained N224 billion to close at N20.409 trillion. The market had rebounded the previous week after declining in May. Analysts had attributed the decline in May partly to indecision among traders despite better than expected corporate earnings in the midst of weak economic data and rising insecurity challenges. “The low traded volume and mixed sentiment for the Month may is a reflection of inactive position of institutional investors as recovery yields in the fixed income space is diverting funds from the stock market,” an analyst had said. However, the trend changed in first week of June as investors took position in expectation that interim dividends for H1 2021 would begin to roll in soon. The market extended its bullish trend to last week, leading to a gain of N224 billion. And analysts in Cordros Securities stated that they expect investors to continue cherry-picking stocks ahead of the H1-2021 dividend declarations this week. “With the recent development in the FI market, we are approaching an inflexion point; we, therefore, see scope for increased buying interest from risk-averse investors. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” they said.
