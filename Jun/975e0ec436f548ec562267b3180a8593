 DStv and GOtv Customers are set to be treated to a thrilling finale of the UEFA Euro 2020 group stage matches.  In Group D, Croatia is set to face Scotland in Glasgow at 8pm. The clash between Croatia and Scotland is something of a do or die: a draw between the teams would probably not be enough for either to advance as one of the best third-place teams, meaning both must lay it all on the line for victory. This will air on SS Football (DStv channel 205 and GOtv channel 31).  Czech Republic will take on England in London at 8pm on SS EURO2020 (DStv channel 204 & GOtv channel 32). England are on the same level with the Czechs on four points, with both teams guaranteed a top three finish and effectively through to the Round of 16. Yet the Three Lions will be looking to make a major statement.

Sweden will take on Poland in Saint Petersburg at 5pm live on SS Football (DStv channel 205 and GOtv channel 31). Sweden needs only a draw against Poland to guarantee a top-two finish.
