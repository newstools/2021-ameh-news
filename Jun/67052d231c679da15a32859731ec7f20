THE Edo State Government and the state All Progressive Congress are at loggerheads over the demolition of structures deemed illegal by the government. Some of the structures affected are shopping malls, hotels and other commercial buildings. The Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, in a statement on Tuesday, said the exercise was aimed at ensuring order and sanitising the environment space in line with the extant laws and guidelines in the state for the benefit of Edo people. The statement reads, “The Edo State Government hereby informs the general public and property developers in particular that government is intensifying the removal of shopping malls, hotels and other commercial buildings erected without appropriate approvals from the relevant regulatory authorities. “The exercise is aimed at ensuring order and sanitising the built environment space in line with the extant laws and guidelines in the state for the benefit of the generality of Edo people. “In essence, all buildings and structures planned, being developed or completed in different parts of the state without approvals are to be discontinued and (or) removed. The same applies to such structures being embarked upon in unapproved locations across the state.” However, the APC, in a statement signed by its State Chairman, Col. David Imuse (retd.), condemned the demolition of one property at 13, Aideyan Street, on the Ihama axis, and another housing over 60 stores, which was undergoing construction at 90, Akenzua Road, both in Benin City.
