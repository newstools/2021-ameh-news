The National Youth Service Corps has appealed for increased deployment of troops in its orientation camps across the country to protect corps members from bandits, kidnappers and other criminal elements.
The Chairman of the NYSC Governing Council, Amb. Fatima Abubakar, made the request at the Army Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday, when she led other members of the council on a courtesy visit to the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru.
Abubakar noted that the security provided at NYSC camps by soldiers during the #EndSARS protests, prevented the wanton destruction of properties at the camps by hoodlums.
She said, “We appreciate the training the Nigerian Army gives the youths. It shapes them and trains them for the tasks ahead. We are pleading that you beef up troops at the NYSC camps because the camps have become so large these days, not like it was at the beginning.
“In a particular camp, sometimes, you have 1,000 young men and women during orientation and we dont have enough troops, especially because of the growing security challenges of abductions and kidnappings.” Attahiru in his response commended the NYSC for instilling in the youth the attitude of patriotism and loyal service to their fatherland.
He advised the NYSC management to introduce patriotism and entrepreneurship as subjects in their orientation programmes to enhance national development.
