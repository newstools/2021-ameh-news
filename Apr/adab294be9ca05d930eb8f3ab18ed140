The Ondo State Government has again alleged that the immediate former deputy governor of the state, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has yet to return government’s vehicles in his possession. In a letter addressed to the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Bolaji Salami, and signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale, the state government alleged that Ajayi is still withholding four government vehicles despite leaving office since February. A copy of the letter was made available to our correspondent on Tuesday. According to the petition, all entreaties to the former deputy governor to return the vehicles for the use of the incumbent deputy governor were rebuffed by Ajayi. The letter read, ”Our office has the firm directive of the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, to recover all government properties still in the possession of former political office holders in the state, especially those who served in the immediate past administration. “Our record confirms that Mr Agboola Ajayi, the immediate past deputy governor of Ondo State, is still holding on to four vehicles owned by the government. “All entreaties to him to return these vehicles for the use of the incumbent occupier of the office have been rebuffed. We lodge this complaint believing that you will use your good offices to look into this brazen act of conversion, and this is being charitable. “Any person who keeps/detains the property of another with the intent to deprive the owner permanently, of the right conferred therefrom, has committed an offence known in law as stealing.”
