The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) said the inter agency committee has again clamped down on six unseaworthy barges operating illegally within the Lagos inland waterways.   Engr Sarat Lara Braimah, NIWA, Lagos Area Manager AmehNews recall that following increasing reports of abuses of process in the operation of barges and private jetties, the  joint operations team in March clamped down on some unseaworthy barges while three illegal jetties were been sealed.    The establishment of an inter-agency committee comprises; representatives of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Nigerian Maritime Administration Agency (NIMASA), Nigerian Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the Lagos State Inland Waterways Authority (LASWA).    The committee in March commenced the “clearing of the waterways of lay-by barges and tugboats along Ibeji/Ilashe axis and as far as the Kirikiri Lighter Terminal and Mile Two Bridge, as well as the removal of wrongly anchored barges that are obstructing visibility along the Kirikiri channel.   But speaking with the Lagos Area Manager of NIWA, shortly after a parley with the Nigerian Shippers’Council, Engineer Sarat Lara Buraimah   told our correspondent that the water crafts were intercepted along the Lagos waterways because of “unseaworthy condition”.   Buraimah said that the joint patrol has been effectively man by personnel of the combined agencies and has so far reduced the number of accident, unlicensed jetties and unseaworthy water crafts along the brown waters in Lagos.   She warned operators with fake licenses and documents to register with the appropriate agencies of the government, saying there will be no hiding place for them to operate barging activities in Lagos.
