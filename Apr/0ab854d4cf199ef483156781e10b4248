Our attention has been drawn to a report credited to the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (NEITI) that the exact volume of Nigeria’s crude production is not known.  We wish to state that this assertion is false in its entirety and should be disregarded, as every litre of crude produced in Nigeria is adequately captured during the process of extraction.  In a statement endorsed and sent by Paul osu the Head, Public Affairs DPR to The AmehNews saying the monitoring of crude oil production and accounting is the primary responsibility of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the basis for determination of the government’s take through royalty payments by operators for sustainable development.  The statement noted that as a further step to boosting crude accounting process from production to export, DPR recently launched the National Production Monitoring System (NPMS), an online platform for direct and independent acquisition of production data from oil and gas facilities in Nigeria.  “NPMS as an electronic data transmission tool at production and export terminals is  designed to better predict the performance of oil and gas reservoirs and better production forecasting.  “The NPMS tool enables DPR to exercise surveillance, perform production monitoring and data analysis for utilisation and forecasting.  “DPR as business enabler and opportunity house will continue to develop robust and strategic initiatives to ensure timely and accurate payment of rents, royalties and other revenues due to the government.
