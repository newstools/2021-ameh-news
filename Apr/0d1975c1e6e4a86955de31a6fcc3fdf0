This will come after ASUPâ€™s meeting with the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu in Abuja. The spokesperson, ministry of labour and employment, Mr Charles Akpan, confirmed that the FG would meet with the ASUP and the JUSUN to address their grievances and get them to re-open the polytechnics and the courts, respectively.
