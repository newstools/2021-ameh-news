THE Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, was non-committal on Wednesday when he was asked to disclose the actual date that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would return to the country from London. Wednesday made it 15 days after Buhari left the country on March 30 for what the Presidency described as routine medical check-up in London. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had disclosed in a statement that Buhari was due back in the country “during the second week of April, 2021.” When State House correspondents, shortly after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting in the Presidential Villa, Abuja, asked Mohammed the exact date the President would be back, the minister said he did not understand the big deal about the matter. “Today is Wednesday; this week finishes on Saturday. So, what is the big issue in that one,” the minister asked. Mohammed said the government was currently more concerned about the security challenges facing the country. He said the Federal Government had demonstrated through a town hall meeting held in Kaduna last week that it was committed to the security of the country.
