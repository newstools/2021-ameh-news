 THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has apologised for the delay in the commencement of its registration which it said was “speculated” to begin on Thursday. A statement issued on Thursday by the spokesperson of JAMB, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, disclosed that the delay was caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by its determined effort to have National Identity Number integration. He said, “To be sure all processes are completed before the commencement, the Board didn’t placed its advertorial as it was yet to complete the process of a smooth pin vending and candidate access to the registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE. “The advertisement is the surest indication of the beginning of the exercise as it has all the step-by-step process that candidates are required to follow. However, this delay is caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by our determined effort to have NIN integration. “This challenge is being resolved and once that is done, all processes shall commence. Candidates are therefore requested to exercise some patience. The process shall be up and running shortly for our advertisement to be rolled out so that candidates can begin the creation of profile.”
