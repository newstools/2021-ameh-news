Suspected Fulani herdsmen have again killed a  56-year-old farmer, Muftau Babarinde, in the Ibarapa area of Oyo State. The incident was said to have happened at Orita Merin, Konko village, in the Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state.  Our correspondent gathered on Thursday that the victim, who was an indigene of Tapa town in the same local government area, was waylaid and killed while going back home from his around 7pm on Wednesday. Some residents of the area accused some aides of the Fulani warlord, Iskilu Wakili, of being behind the attack. Recall that members of Odua People’s Congress and other vigilantes arrested Wakili in February and handed him over to the police. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Adewale Osifeso, when contacted, said he would get back to our correspondent. However, the convener of Igangan Development Advocates, Mr Oladiran Oladokun, confirmed the killing. He said, “The man was popular in this area. The Fulani herdsmen inflicted machete cuts on him and made sure he was dead before they left. “We are angry at what is going on here in Ibarapa. Our people are being killed and maimed, but the state government is not doing anything about it. The Federal Government is also not protecting us. We cannot continue like this. “We may soon begin to start dumping anybody killed by Fulani at the Governor’s Office for them to know that our people are being killed.”
