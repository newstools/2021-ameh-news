… Zero Allocation To FAAC For April, May  The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has recorded a shortfall in revenue of N111,966,456,903.74 in February 2021. The source cited in the memos sent to government agencies from the country’s apex fuel importer-supplier, NNPC was recording a shortage of N56 for every litre of PMS being imported into Nigeria currently.   It said its shortfall came from the landing cost of fuel spiralling upward by “N184 per litre as against the subsisting ex-coastal price of N128 per litre” as the Federal Government and Labour were still negotiating the pump price of fuel.  The corporation, in a letter to the Accountant-General of the Federation, stated that the NNPC would therefore not be contributing to the FAAC for April and May.  The letter, dated April 26, and  signed  by the Chief Financial Officer, Umar Ajiya Isa, noted that the sum of N111,966,456,903.74 incurred as landing costs would be deducted from April 2021 Oil and Gas Proceeds due to the Federation in May 2021, which will translate to zero remittance to the Federation Account from NNPC in the month of May 2021.
