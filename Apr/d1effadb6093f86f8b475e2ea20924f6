The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has moved the South-West Congress of the party to Osogbo, Osun State and fixed Monday, April 12  for the exercise. The party had earlier fixed Saturday, April 10 for the exercise in Ibadan, the Oyo State. However, the disagreement between two main factions of the party in the zone being led by former governor Ayo Fayose and incumbent Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, forced the party to reschedule the exercise. The party took the decision after an emergency meeting held with the gladiators on Wednesday. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement after the emergency meeting the NWC and the gladiators, said the matter had been finally resolved. Part of the statement read, “After further comprehensive deliberations on issues of concern in the South-West zonal chapter of the PDP, we resolve as follows: “That the South-West Zonal Congress of our great party is scheduled for Monday, April 12, 2021 in Osogbo, Osun State capital. “The PDP national leadership assures of working with all stakeholders to achieve a seamless and unifying congress of our great party in the South-West zone.
