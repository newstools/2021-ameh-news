The equities market attracted a total of N19.272 billion invested in 2.342 billion in 20,173 deals last week amidst the continuing bearish trend that led to a negative close for the seventh consecutive week. The value of investment was lower than the N23.541 billion staked on 1.675 billion shares in 21,732 deals the previous week. The persistent weak sentiments made the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) to depreciate by 0.69 per cent to close at 38,382.39, while market capitalisation close lower at N20.082 trillion. Consequently, the year-to-date decline printed at 4.7 per cent.
Analysts said they expect the bearish trend to continue this week as investors await the outcome of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which begins today.
“We expect investors’ attention to be focused on the outcome of the MPC meeting as they seek clarity on the direction of yields in the fixed income market. “We expect the choppy trading pattern that played out last week to persist in this week, as investors continue to cherry-pick dividend-paying stocks and at the same time remain cautious about leaving gains in the market. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts at Cordros Securities said.
