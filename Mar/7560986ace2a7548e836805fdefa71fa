The Federal Road Safety Corps, Ogun State Sector Command, has booked a driver, Isiaka Sanusi, who was flagged down by an operative on suspicion of dangerous driving during the Sector Commander’s special patrol operation at Ewekoro According to a statement on Wednesday, the FRSC noted that there was the need for the country’s roads to be filled with sane and psychologically fit drivers.  The statement read in part, “Some flagrant infraction of traffic rules and regulations need to be checked scientifically in order to ascertain the mental eligibility of offenders. The FRSC Ogun Command, on Wednesday, booked one Isiaka Sanusi, following the display of an act of insanity when he was stopped by operatives of the organisation at Itori in the early hours of the day. “On apprehension, Sanusi decided to display further his psychological imbalance when he stripped himself naked, thereby causing an embarrassing scene for himself. He was, however, calmed down through the assistance of the men of the Nigeria Police Force, Ewekoro Division, and thereafter he was booked accordingly. “He was later recommended for psychological evaluation on the directives of the Sector Commander of the Ogun Sector Command Corps, Ahmed Umar, who warned the motoring public against harassment of operatives while discharging their duties as such would not be handled with levity.”
