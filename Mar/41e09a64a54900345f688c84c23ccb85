The Court of Appeal (Abuja Division), on Thursday, dismissed the alleged certificate forgery case filed by the All Progressives Congress, against Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. The appellate court dismissed the suit for lacking in merit and awarded N250,000 cost in favour of governor Obaseki. The APC had in its suit alleged that the University of Ibadan Degree Certificate presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission by Obaseki, was forged. Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed of a Federal High Court, Abuja, had on January 9, 2021 dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against the governor. The judge described APCâ€™s allegation as strange and like a story of an outsider telling a man in his house that he is not the father of a child. Not satisfied with the decision of the High court, the APC took the matter to the Appeal Court. However, delivering judgment in the appeal on Thursday, Justice Stephen Adah held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusion in the suit. Justice Adah upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar (Legal), of the University of Ibadan, Abayomi Ajayi, who confirmed that Obaseki attended the University in 1976 and fulfilled the requirement for admission to study Classics. He also held that the evidence of the Deputy Registrar was direct in showing that Obaseki did not forge any of the certificates he submitted to the INEC.
