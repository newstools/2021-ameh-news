The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has given bank employees June 1, 2021 deadline to declare their assets. EFCC Chairman, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, told State House correspondents yesterday in Abuja after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari that the move was aimed at checking the role of banks in keeping funds acquired illegitimately. He stated that he discussed with the president efforts of the commission towards eradicating financial crimes. He said: “Let me just put this, we understood that at the tail end of every financial crime is for the criminal to have access to the funds that he or she has illegitimately gotten and we’re worried about the roles of financial institutions. “And we have discussed, but we hope that all financial institutions, particularly the bankers, will declare their assets as provided for by the law, in accordance with the Bank Employees Declaration of Assets Act. “And that the EFCC, come the 1st of June 2021, will be demanding these asset declaration forms, filled by the bankers so that the line that we have drawn from the 1st of June is really complied with by bankers in particular,” he said. He added that the agency has arrested about 300 cybercriminals nationwide between February and March. “As a young man, I am appealing to all young Nigerians to desist from these cybercrime activities. It is bringing a bad image to our country. It is giving a bad name to our country. It is also chasing away a lot of foreign investment that we need. “And I call on all parents, guardians, and, of course, elders in the community, in the society to talk to these young people to desist from these crimes. “These are crimes that they commit online. And of course, there is nothing like patting your back to say go and sin no more. Our laws do not provide for that. It is a crime and as we say in EFCC, EFCC will get you anywhere, anytime,” Bawa said.
