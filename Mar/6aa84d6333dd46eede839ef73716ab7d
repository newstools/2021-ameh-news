The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) wishes to inform the general public that, as part of our maintenance and upgrade program, the E-Finger departure screening point of Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) has been temporarily closed to carry out some routine maintenance on the screening machines. Consequently, all human and cargo movement have been temporarily diverted to the D-Finger screening area until the maintenance and upgrade is completed. The Authority appeals to passengers and other airport users to please bear with us, as we hope to reopen the area as soon as possible. FAAN…… Committed to her core values of Safety, Security and Comfort.
