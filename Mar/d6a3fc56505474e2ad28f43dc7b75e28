Gunmen have abducted four residents of Kiyi village in the Kuje Area Council, Abuja. The hoodlums, who were said to be armed with AK-47 rifles reportedly stormed their victims’ homes on Wednesday and whisked them away at gunpoint. They were said to have demanded N50m each from their victims, who included a Federal Capital Territory Administration worker, Olalekan Salami, a taxi driver, motorcyclist, and a technician.

A family member of one of the victims said the hoodlums broke into the victims’ homes after tearing down the iron doors and took away the men through the nearby hills. The Federal Capital Territory Police Public Relations Officer, Mariam Yusuf, confirmed the incident. “Four persons were kidnapped at Kiyi village area of Kuje axis; we have launched an operation for the rescue of the victims and to apprehend the fleeing suspects,” she said.
