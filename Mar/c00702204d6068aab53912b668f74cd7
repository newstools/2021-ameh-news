The Abia State Government on Wednesday accused an opposition party of allegedly importing hoodlums into Aba since Monday, as part of plans to manipulate the March 27 Aba North/Aba South Federal Constituency election. The state Commissioner for Information, Chief John Kalu, made the allegation in a statement made available to journalists. “About 200 armed youths have already been camped at a location and are awaiting deployment with fake military uniforms made available to them by an Abia-born retired Army General who only recently joined the opposition party with the intention of unleashing mayhem on the people of the state,” Kalu alleged. He therefore asked security agencies in the state to ensure that the hoodlums already in the state are immediately apprehended while others on the way are prevented from entering the state. He added, “Our intelligence confirms that the plan of the opposition party is to overheat the polity as a prelude to calling for full deployment of the military which will in turn create room for them to deploy the hoodlums with fake uniforms and the already procured arms. “We wish to make it abundantly clear to those behind the dastardly plot that their plans are fully known and will surely not only be resisted but also completely thwarted.”
