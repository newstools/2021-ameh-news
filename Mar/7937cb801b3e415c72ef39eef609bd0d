Similarly, the EBITDA margin rose by 1.7ppts to 46.1% in Full Year 2020.  On a geographical basis, Nigeria EBITDA margin weakened by 0.7ppts to 58.5% due to the pass-through effect of the local currency’s devaluation on dollar-linked cost items.

On the other hand, Pan African Operations EBITDA strengthened by 5.5ppts to 22.4% in Full Year 2020, the highest on record and substantially above the four-year average of 15.6%.

This was supported by the blend of the higher interest income grew by 73.2% year on year, a foreign exchange gain of N16.63 billion in Full Year 2020, which was absent in Full Year 2019, and the high base finance cost in Full Year 2019 due to foreign exchange losses of N13.48 billion.  Adjusting for the impact of the Forex gain in Full Year 2020 and Forex loss in Full Year 2019, net finance cost would have declined by 15.8% year on year in FY-20. “Net operating cash flow (NOCF) rose by 20.1% year on year to N511.88 billion in Full Year 2020, driven by efficient working capital management as inventories declined by 5.7% year on year while trade payables rose by 22.2% year on year. The growth in NOCF supported the increase in cash and cash equivalents grew by 25.8% year on year to N141.04 billion which proved instrumental in the double-digit expansion in finance income grew by 73.2% year on year despite the lower yield environment in 2020. “Overall, PBT grew by 49.0% year on year in Full Year 2020 with related PBT margin improving by 8.0ppts to 36.0%, on the back of the moderation in net finance cost and gains from cost management.

Comment: Cordros Research analysts said that the company’s revenue hit the N1 trillion marks, making DANGCEM the third listed entity on the NSE to have achieved this feat aside from MTNN and AIRTELAFRI. Analysts are also impressed by the additional 3MTA added to the Obajana cement plant in August 2020 and the record EBITDA margin achieved in Pan African Operations. With the Tanzanian power plant’s commissioning in November 2020, we (Analysts) believe this will support Pan African EBITDA margins going forward.  “However, we remain concerned about Nigeria’s cost pressures due to a weaker currency. From a market standpoint, we believe investors will react positively to the company’s solid earnings.”
