The Central Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday, inaugurated the new executives of the party in Borno State. The event followed last week’s resolution of several years of litigation which led to a prolonged crisis in the party. The Deputy National Chairman of the PDP (North), Suleiman Nazif, supervised the inauguration of the new Chairman, Usman Badairi, and other executives on behalf of the national chairman, Uche Secondus. Nazif commended the leaders of the party in the state for ensuring peace despite the litigation and encouraged them to make the party stronger. “The Supreme Court’s judgment is a blessing to our members in Borno State because it unified them and made them to speak with one voice as they pledged to work together as a team,” he said. He appealed to the new chairman and other leaders of the party to work with every member in the state. He said, “You should work with your predecessors to achieve the task of building a formidable party in the state. “This is an opportunity to ensure that what happened in 2019 is not allowed to repeat itself.” He asked them to ensure victory for the party in the forthcoming general elections. The new chairman pledged to work towards a united party in the state. Meanwhile, one of the aspirants in the Anambra governorship election on the platform of the PDP, Obiora Okonkwo, has pledged to use his private sector experience to turn around the economy of the state, if elected. Okonkwo, who submitted his nomination form to contest the poll, said while others were telling the electorate what they would do, he was telling them that he would continue his good works.
