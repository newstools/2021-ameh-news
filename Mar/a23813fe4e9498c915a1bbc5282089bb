 THE Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress in Edo State on Tuesday engaged in a verbal war over a list by the All Progressives Congress National Secretariat, described as ‘Contract/Strategy Committee,’ wherein the PDP noted that not a single member was included from the APC in Edo State. The Contact/Strategy Committee was set up by the APC to help reach both members and intending members with a view strategise for 2023. The state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare, said excluding Edo members from the list meant that the National Secretariat did not reckon with the Edo APC. He said, “Their leaders as far as Abuja is concerned are political hustlers. You will notice that in that very long list, not one person that claims to be a member of APC in Edo was considered worthy to serve on that committee. “Edo APC doesn’t exist in the eyes of the National Secretariat of the APC. Is it that its membership and brand here in Edo have been so decimated that they are now political orphans?” However, Assistant Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state, Ofure Osehobo, said the claim by the PDP that no member was included in Edo was false; just as he described the party as busybodies to spread falsehood. Osehobo said, “It is in the PDP character, even nationwide, as a party of busybodies to spread falsehood. It is therefore not a surprise because the lies are an attempt by a dying party to console itself for its failures which are legendary and seek a semblance of relevance.”
