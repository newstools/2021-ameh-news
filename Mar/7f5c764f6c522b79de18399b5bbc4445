The report further noted that local raw-materials utilization in the sector declined to 57.45% in 2020 from 60.5% recorded in 2019 adding that the decline in local raw-materials utilization in the sector was attributed to the opening up of world economies for trade after months of global lockdown.  Manufacturers are therefore, able to increase import raw-materials, also noted.  MAN also noted that the pandemic had a crushing impact on the manufacturing sector as the sector fell into economic recession in the 3rd quarter of 2020.  At the moment and following the impact of COVID-19 productivity in the sector is at the lowest and therefore requires deliberately orchestrated action to rekindle significant productive activities in the sector, it stressed.
