The report stated that MAN has to tutored government the way to managing COVID-19 by “Strike a balance in managing the economy and the second wave of COIVID-19 without implementing a second lockdown as Nigerian economy already in recession and cannot afford a second lockdown.  “Allow manufacturing to continue operation in all sub-manufacturing sectors notwithstanding any new wave of COVID-19 – These companies have already imbibed the new normal of COVID-19: they have built up the stock of capacity and adopted international measures needed to work under the current environment.  “Allow free movement of goods and persons across states but should be supported with best implementation of COVID-19 guidelines such as use of nose and face mask, social distancing, etc. Also interstate travel ban will impact negatively on productive activities by the private sector and will lead to loss of jobs.
