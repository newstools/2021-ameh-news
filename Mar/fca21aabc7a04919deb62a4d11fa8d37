Alex. A. Okoh, Director General of Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in his paper titled PPP as Alternative Financing Model in the Maritime Sector presented at the Nigerian-South African Chamber of Commerce Breakfast virtual Forum advocates for a new approach to the development and maintenance of maritime infrastructure in Nigeria using PPP arrangements. Mr Okoh, Director General, BPE who was represented by Amaechi Aloke, a director in the BPE further said through a well structured PPP arrangement, Nigeria could attract credible investors and investment capital to further expand the infrastructure within the maritime sector  He added that it reviews the current philosophy on PPP practice in Nigeria; the state of the Nigerian maritime infrastructure and the enormous investments required to develop its infrastructure in order to remain competitive and accelerate economic growth and development.  The SIFAX Group in partnership with the Nigeria South Africa Chamber of Commerce organized a webinar series discussed alternative financing model for Nigeria’s maritime sector tags Breakfast virtual Forum on Thursday March 25th, 2021  The BPE DG disclosed that the BPE has adopted the APMG PPP Guides definition of PPP which clearly encapsulates the features of the requirements of this presentation. Though generally, the term PPP is usually referred to as any form of association or co-operation between the public and private sectors for the purpose of attaining a common goal, he added  “A long term contract between a public party and a private party for the development (or significant upgrade or renovation) and management of a public asset (including potentially the management of a related public service), in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility throughout the life of the contract, provides a significant portion of the finance at its own risk, and remuneration is significantly linked to performance and/or the demand or use of the asset or service so as to align the interests of both parties.”  He pointed out the Key factor in the PPP to include, Long-term nature of the contract, the private party is responsible for development and management of the public assets, the private party bears a significant management responsibility and risk and The Private party provides a significant portion of the finance Remuneration is linked to performance  Mr Okoh noted that the maritime sector includes all enterprises engaged in the business of designing, constructing, manufacturing, acquiring, operating, supplying, repairing and/or maintaining vessels, or component parts thereof; Or The management/operation of shipping lines; stevedoring and customs brokerage services; freight forwarding services and similar enterprises.  “In addition to shipping, transport and ports services, maritime related enterprises and activities are also concerned with resource exploitation at sea, the leisure/tourism industries, professional business services and the public service  Maritime Sector in Nigeria: Maritime transportation in Nigeria consists of a complex structure of inter-related and inter-connected activities such as ship-harbor, that is, pilotage, dredging, provision of berth, maintenance of navigable channels, stevedoring etc. There is also ship-port interface loading and unloading of cargoes; freight and services; and port-land interface delivering cargo to and from the connected hinterland. Furthermore, there is room for other services to be procured and rendered such as those mentioned in the previous slide. These different functions require different strategies, approaches and organizations. Nigeria has a great potential for a buoyant maritime industry and to enjoy these benefits, it is vital that the Nigerian maritime transport system operate efficiently and resourcefully. He recalls it was because of the need for efficiency in the sector that the Federal Government in 2005/06 through NCP/BPE reformed the Ports by way of concession (a mode of PPP) with Objectives: Ø To increase efficiency of the port operations; Ø To decrease costs of the port services to the port users; Ø To relieve the government of budgetary commitments to the sector; Ø To boost economic activity and accelerate development; and Ø To make Nigeria the hub for international freight and trade in West Africa  In the years just succeeding the concession of the ports, there were marked improvements in the area of income generation as depicted in the table below:  BPE Boss said the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) may have scored above average in increasing its revenue profile through the concession, but operators and customers alike, even to date, complain of high charges; high dwell time; poor infrastructure; and unfriendly business environment at the ports. He added that it has become obvious to the Bureau and most experts that more investment is required to improve the services and infrastructure in and around the ports.  The need for Investments in and Around the Ports “It is clear to the Bureau that whilst shipping and terminal charges are comparatively higher in Nigeria, it is the cost incurred over failing infrastructure that has affected the overall cost the most. This shows that there is a clear, intrinsic relationship between the maritime sector and the transport infrastructure in a country “Due to the constraining fiscal space and increasing demand for investment on other sectors of the economy, government cannot fund the infrastructure requirement in the maritime industry “It therefore means that alternative sources of income would have to be relied upon to procure maritime and indeed other development infrastructure  BPE appreciates the Nigerian-South Sounth African Chamber of Commerce for organising this most important webinar. We are also using this opportunity to call private sectors players to bring in their wealth of knowledge, pedigree and capital to accelerate the development of not just the maritime operations and services in the country but the entire infrastructure landscape, he added.
