The one- day activity which will feature a Press conference on the effect of insecurity and Covid-19 on women in Nigeria will take place on Tuesday 9th March,2021 at the MMS International Image Centre, Lagos.  The 2021 IWD international  theme is: “Women  In Leadership: Achieving an Equal Future in Covid-19 World” with a hash tag message as #Choose to Challenge.  However, to address our peculiar challenges in Nigeria, we have chosen to have our local theme as “The Future is Female”, said the co- founder of MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke.  According to Anaroke, Barr. Obiageli Obi, former Director-General, Nigerian Chamber of Shipping(NCS), will be speaking on “The Direct and Indirect  Impact of Covid-19 on Women” while  Mrs. Chizoba  Anyika, Assistant Director, Shipping Development, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency(NIMASA), will speak on “ Developing  Your Leadership Potential: Knowing What, When and How”.  MMS WOFHOF Initiative has over about 100 women leaders from Nigeria and Africa inducted into its Hall of Fame as Hall of Famers and Amazons. These are leaders committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in their various fields and beyond in this interdependent and inextricably linked world. They have demonstrated  this through their lives, work and leadership.
