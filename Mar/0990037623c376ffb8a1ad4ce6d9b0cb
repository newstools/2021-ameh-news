According to the results released to the Nigerian Stock Exchange the Nestle’s profit fell by 14 per cent from the last year’s profit N45.683 billion to N39.212 billion in the year 2020.  Nestle Nigeria Plc is in the history of rewarding shareholders with good dividend yearly and this year cannot be different, therefore it has recommended a higher dividend payment ratio. And as regular high dividend pay company it has decided to dip its hands into its retained profit to pay shareholders higher dividend for the year ended December 31, 2020  The directors of the company therefore recommend the payment of a final dividend of N35.50 per share having earlier declared an interim dividend of N25, to bring the total dividend to N60.50. The dividend payout amounted to N47.95 billion, which is higher than the N39.212 billion profit recorded in 2020.  If approve by the shareholders in the company during upcoming Annual General Meetings (AGM) the proposed final dividend of N35.50 comprise N24.50 from the after tax profit for the year ended 31 December 2020, and N5.00 and N6 from the after tax retained earnings of the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively.   The Nestle Nigeria Poor financial performance for the year under review was attributed to high financing cost, the high inflationary pressure, increased excise duty, value-added tax, and the coronavirus pandemic.   The full year results disclosed a net finance costs surged by 546.3% as finance costs growth 303.2% year on year ballooned in Q4,2020. This is attributable to the N1.73 billion net FX loss recorded in the period, noted the report.  The report further stated that operating profit weakness and finance cost pressure drove EPS down by 17.7% year on year to N9.18 in Q4, 2020 – the smallest quarterly EPS print since Q3, 2017.  The Nestle Nigeria reported EPS of N9.18 recorded a loss of 17.7% year on year, bringing the 2020Full Year EPS to N49.47 representing 14.2% loss year on year.   The report cited Net financing cost soared by 302 per cent from N938 million to N3.78 billion. The increase in finance cost was primarily due to a multi-fold increase in foreign exchange losses to N1.7 billion from N37.3 million in 19.  Consequently, profit before tax fell from N71.124 billion to N60.638 billion, while profit after tax printed at N39.212 billion, compared with N45.683 billion in 2019.  According to analysts at Cordros Research in compared to Q3, 2020, EPS was down 28.1% quarter on quarter, weighed down by the weaker gross margin representing 145bps decline, higher OPEX of 12.2% and higher net finance costs of 523.2%. In the quarter, the effective tax rate was 36.1%, compared to 34.3% and 39.3% in Q3, 2020 and Q4, 2019, respectively.  Still in 2020Full Year report: EPS fell by14.2% on a full-year basis, following muted revenue growth of 1.1% representing a 359bps gross margin contraction and the surge in net finance costs of 302.9%.  Notably, total debt increased by 198.3% year on year to N39.42 billion which represent 3x of total debt at the end of 2019FY.  Analysts recall that the company paid off its outstanding FX debt of N5.52 billion represents USD15.25 million due to its parent company in Q1, 2020. However, in April and September of 2020, two new 7-year USD100 million parent company loans were approved, of which the company had drawn down USD72.50 million and USD7.0 million as of end-December. Total debt is now at the highest level since Q2, 2017 and translates to a debt/equity ratio of 1.4x, up from 0.3x and 0.2x in 2019Full Year and 2018Full Year, respectively.  FCF generation was significantly stronger at N84.42 billion in 2020Full Year compare with 2019Full Year of N36.58 billion, reflecting favourable working capital movements as the company focused attention on receivables management (trade receivables days improved to 50 days from 85 days as of 2019Full Year). The company was also able to significantly increase its payables days to 254 days from 184 days in 2019Full Year.  Comment: Experts at Cordros Research revealed that NESTLE’s Q4 and 2020 Full Year operating performance was in line with our expectation. However, concerns remain around the ballooning finance costs amidst the much larger foreign currency debt profile and the lingering naira weakness.  Despite the overall weakness during the period, we expect the focus to be on the still positive Full Year earnings and higher-than-expected dividend.  “The operating and net margin slumped 293 bps and 242 bps, by 22.4 per cent and 13.7 per cent, respectively, in 2020. The profit before tax for both the segments declined in 2020.  Food segment profit slipped 15.8 per cent to N39.6 billion, while beverage segment profit edged 0.8 per cent lower to N24.8 billion in 2020,” the analysts said.  Explaining, its response to the COVID-19, Nestle Nigeria said it engaged with internal and relevant external stakeholders to ensure the safety of its people while keeping its business running to meet the needs of consumers across the country.  “We worked alongside the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), Association of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Employees (AFBTE), Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other stakeholders to set up guidelines and necessary precautionary safety measures across all sites while maintaining regular communication channels.  “We engaged with the Governors’ Forum, the Ministry of Trade and Investment as well as the OPS to ensure that our operations continued uninterrupted during the period of the lockdowns. All manufacturers in the food and beverage sector were classified as essential services and excluded from the lockdown,” it said.  Nestle Nigeria noted that notwithstanding the exemption, it encountered challenges with the availability of key raw and packaging materials including sugar.  “The prices of some materials increased exponentially while access to foreign exchange for the importation of key items became more restricted. Heightened insecurity compelled some of our distributors to shut down. The closure or partial closure of key markets and the lack of patronage at the make-shift markets opened by some state governments also put pressure on the business during the period.”
