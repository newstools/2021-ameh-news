Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) computed from a survey of over 400 manufacturing companies in Nigeria for the 4th quarter of 2020 disclosed that the manufacturing capacity utilization edged up to 53.7% in the 2nd half of 2020 from 43.2% recorded in the 1st half of the year; thus, indicating 8.5 percentage point increase over the period. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in its Executive Summary and Bi-Annual Review of the Economy from July through to December 2020 released however, showed declined of 5.74% when compared with 59.44% recorded in the corresponding half of 2019.  Therefore, the capacity utilization in the sector averaged stood at 49.5% in 2020 as against 56.8% recorded in 2019. The Association noted that the uptick in capacity utilization in the period is attributed to the relaxing of the COVID-19 containment measures, particularly the opening of the economy for business activities in the 2nd half 2020. The increase is also seasonally influenced as a result of Christmas celebration boosted economic activities in the last quarter of the year, it was added.  The report further stated that year 2020 was a very difficult year for the economy and manufacturing sector due to the onslaught of COVID-19 Pandemic adding that COVID-19 had a staggering devastation on global economies as evident in the huge death toll of manpower; as a results of the crashing of crude oil price, the slowing of global supply and demand; and the total halting of economic activities through the lockdown.  MAN also noted that the pandemic had a crushing impact on the manufacturing sector as the sector fell into economic recession in the 3rd quarter of 2020.Â  At the moment and following the impact of COVID-19 productivity in the sector is at the lowest and therefore requires deliberately orchestrated action to rekindle significant productive activities in the sector, it stressed.
